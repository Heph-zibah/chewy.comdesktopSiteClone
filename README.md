### What I learned

I learned about the efficacy of utility classes. This makes my work easier as I only has to reuse them. 

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
 <div class="section-container">
                <h3>35% Off your Autoship</h3>
                <a href="#">Shop All Autoship</a>
                <i class="fa-solid fa-angle-right easter-icon"></i>
                <div class="discovery-images">
                    <div class="card">
                        <div class="card-image">
                            <img src="img/autoshipSection/auto1.jpg" alt="">
                        </div>
                        <div class="card-body">
                            <p><a href="#"><span>Frisco</span> St Patricks box of gold hide and seek puzzle plush squeaky dog toy</a></p>
                            <div class="checkout-white">
                                <p>Spend $100 on select Vet Diet Items. Get a $15 eGift Card</p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="icon-ratings">
                                <i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i>
                                <i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i>
                                <i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i>
                                <i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i>
                                <i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i>
                                <small>3000</small>
                            </div>
                            <strong>$16.98</strong>

                        </div>
                    </div>
```
```css
.pet-images,
.categories-images,
.pupKit-images,
.pharmacy-images,
.brand-images {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: space-between;
}
```

### Continued development

I am still not perfect with the naming convention of CSS classes. Therefore, I will keep learning. Also, I will love to learn how to segregate my CSS codes into different files. In this project, I have only one CSS file which means it is one long thread of codes.


### Useful resources

- [ cdnjs](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/font-awesome) - This helped me for the icons. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) -
